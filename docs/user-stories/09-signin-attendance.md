# Sign-in & Attendance

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** use an electronic sign-in sheet for info sessions  
**So that** attendance is automatically tracked and triggers follow-up actions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Digital sign-in interface for info sessions
- When volunteer checks in, they are marked as attended
- Status automatically updates to reflect attendance
- Date and time of attendance is recorded
- Attendance confirmation triggers application email
- System helps track when people attended sessions
