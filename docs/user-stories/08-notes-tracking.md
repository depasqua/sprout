# Notes & Communication Tracking

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** track all communications with notes  
**So that** communication history is always up-to-date

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Notes can be added to any volunteer profile with timestamp and creator
- Notes visible in chronological order and searchable
- Notes automatically created when reminder emails or SMS are sent
- Note includes type of communication and date/time
- Note button clearly separated from delete button in interface
- Easy way to add note "send 4 week follow up email" without opening each profile individually
