# Integration & Administration

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** integrate with external systems and manage settings  
**So that** data stays synchronized and the system is configurable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System notifies when volunteer data is transferred to the external system
- Transfer status visible in volunteer profile with date/time
- When application is submitted, data is sent through a custom API to the external system
- Volunteers remain in the system for future email communications
- Role-based access control for administrators
- Administrators can change reminder frequencies and manage email templates
- System can import historical data from CSV/Excel/JSON files with duplicate detection
