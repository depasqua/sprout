# Application Process

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** automate the application process  
**So that** volunteers receive and submit applications efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application email automatically sent after info session attendance confirmed
- System tracks when application is submitted
- Status automatically changes from "application sent" to "application submitted"
- Volunteer moves to "applied" section when application submitted
- System sends automated reminders to volunteers who received application but haven't submitted
- Reminder frequency is configurable by administrators
