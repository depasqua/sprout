# Status Management

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** track and update volunteer status  
**So that** I know where each volunteer is in the process

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Status can be changed manually or automatically
- Status options: inquiry, attended session, application sent, application submitted, inactive
- Status updates automatically when volunteer attends session or submits application
- Status persists even when volunteer becomes inactive (shows application sent date)
- System prevents duplicate application sends
- Status changes logged with timestamp and user
