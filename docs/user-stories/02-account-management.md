# Account Management

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** manage volunteer accounts without duplicates  
**So that** I can track the full volunteer journey accurately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System prevents duplicate accounts by checking email before creating inquiry
- Inquiry account links to application account (handles cases where different emails are used)
- Relationship between accounts is visible in the system
- System can propagate referrer name/email when referral source is a person
