# Info Session Management

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** create, edit, and cancel information sessions
**So that** I can maintain organized session offerings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Editing an information session notifies attendees
- Creating an information session adds it to the interest form as an option 
- Cancelling an information session notifies attendees and prompts them to choose a new date
- Creating a Zoom information session creates a Zoom link for the meeting
- Notification emails will be sent when the prospective volunteer signs up and to remind them closer to the event
- Cancelling a session removes it from all future sign-up options
