# Email Automation

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** automate email communications  
**So that** I don't need to re-enter data or manually send emails

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System sends automated emails at configurable intervals (2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks)
- Emails sent when volunteers attend, skip, or cancel info sessions to sign up for another information session
- Application email automatically sent after attendance confirmation
- System tracks when each email is sent
- On attendance confirmation: automation stops, volunteer is converted to applicant, and application email is sent automatically
