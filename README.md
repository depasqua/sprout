## 🌱 Sprout – Volunteer Management System

**Sprout** is a Ruby on Rails application that replaces spreadsheet-based workflows with a centralized system for managing the full volunteer lifecycle.

Sprout supports the journey from initial inquiry through information session attendance, application eligibility, and ongoing follow-up — giving staff a clear view of every volunteer’s status in one place.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

- **Volunteer funnel tracking:** Inquiry → info session registered → attended → application eligible → applied → inactive, with a status history timeline.
- **Public inquiry form:** Tablet- and mobile-friendly public form that creates/links volunteers and starts them in the funnel.
- **Admin dashboard:** Staff-facing views to search, filter, and sort volunteers by name, status, and referral source.
- **Information sessions & attendance:** Create sessions, register volunteers, and use an electronic sign-in sheet to record attendance and automatically advance statuses.
- **Notes & communication history:** Inline notes and system-generated entries (status changes, attendance) for a unified volunteer timeline.

## ⚙️ Local Setup (Development)

### Option A: Docker Compose (recommended)

Docker Compose runs Rails, PostgreSQL, and LocalStack together. LocalStack emulates the AWS services (SQS, S3, Lambda, API Gateway) so you can develop the full stack without an AWS account.

**Prerequisites:** [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

```sh
docker compose up
```

This will:
- Build the Rails dev image
- Start PostgreSQL and run migrations automatically
- Start LocalStack and provision all AWS resources (queues, buckets, lambdas, API Gateway)
- Start the Rails server on http://localhost:3000

To rebuild after Gemfile changes:
```sh
docker compose up --build
```

To reset everything (database, LocalStack state):
```sh
docker compose down -v && docker compose up
```

### Option B: Local Ruby (without AWS services)

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

2. **Set up the database**
   ```sh
   bin/rails db:prepare
   ```

3. **Run the server**
   ```sh
   bin/rails server
   ```

Note: AWS integrations (Zoom, Mailchimp, Optima) won't work without LocalStack or real AWS credentials.
